Things to do:
- In activity and conversations, update page when leaving event
- Divide store into multiple modules
- Make a generic Dialog component
  - Extract dialog HTML code from Dashboard view
- Move Firebase functions from auth views to store
- Make more generic components for authentication views (a lot of redundant code in those files)
